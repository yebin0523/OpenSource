## Project Description

This project implements a tool for taking photos using a webcam. It primarily uses the webcam to take photos in real-time or perform related functions.

### Motivation

When taking photos, unwanted subjects or other people are sometimes captured. To prevent this inconvenience of manually covering or using mosaics, we implemented it in Python.
